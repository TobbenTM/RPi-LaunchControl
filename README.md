#RPi-LaunchControl

Fireworks Launch Control using a Raspberry Pi and Android phones.

##RPi

Using node.js there is a small webserver (app.js) that currently displays which channels are ready to fire. 
This is simply triggering the correct GPIO pins.

##Electrical

Currently using a Sainsmart 8-channel relay board, with an isolator in between. May upload schematics sometime.

##Android
